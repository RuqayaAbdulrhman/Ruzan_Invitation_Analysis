## ðŸ“Œ Project Title:
Analyzing Ruzan Invitations â€“ Digital Invitation Design Business

---

## 1. Introduction

Ruzan Invitations is a personal business I started to design custom digital invitations for events like weddings, graduations, engagements, and birthdays.  
As part of my data analysis training with SheCodes Too, I chose to analyze my own project to explore customer trends and improve service quality.

## 2. Dataset Description

The data was structured into 4 relational tables:

- Clients  
  - client_id, full_name, email

- Events  
  - event_id, client_id, event_type, event_date, location

- Invitations  
  - invitation_id, event_id, design_link, sent_date, status

- Payments  
  - payment_id, client_id, amount, payment_date, method

All payments were completed via credit, and most invitations were marked as sent.
